# Outlier Detection Methods

Outlier detection methods are categorized based on whether the data is labeled and the specific technical approach used to identify the anomalies.

## 1. The Story: The High-Security Vault
Imagine a high-security bank vault. The security system needs to distinguish between a **Bank Manager** (Normal) and an **Intruder** (Outlier).

* **Supervised Approach:** The system has a photo database of all known bank managers and all known past intruders. It compares the person at the door to these "labels" to decide.
* **Semi-supervised Approach:** The system only has photos of the "Normal" managers. If the person at the door doesn't match any manager, they are flagged as an intruder.
* **Unsupervised Approach:** The system has no photos at all. Instead, it watches behavior. If 1,000 people walk in calmly, but one person is running and wearing a mask, the system flags the "different" behavior as an outlier.

## 2. Detection Categories

| Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Supervised** | Requires a training set with "Normal" and "Outlier" labels. It is treated as a classification problem. |
| **Unsupervised** | Does not require any labels. It assumes that normal objects are frequent/dense and outliers are rare/isolated. |
| **Semi-supervised** | Training data contains only "Normal" labels. The model learns the normal distribution and flags any deviation. |

## 3. Statistical Data Mining Approaches
Statistical methods assume that the normal data objects are generated by a statistical model (a "distribution"), and data not fitting that model are outliers.

### **A. Z-Score (Parametric)**
This method assumes the data follows a Normal (Gaussian) Distribution. It flags points that are too many standard deviations away from the average.

* **Pros:** Simple, fast, and easy to implement.
* **Cons:** Not reliable for skewed or non-normal data.

### **B. IQR - Interquartile Range (Non-Parametric)**
This method examines the middle 50% of the data. It is the foundation for the "Boxplot" visualization.

* **Pros:** Robust to extreme values and does not assume a normal distribution.
* **Cons:** Does not adapt well to highly skewed distributions.

## **Algorithm: Statistical Detection (Z-Score & IQR)**

### **1. Z-Score Algorithm**
**Basic Working Steps:**
1.  Calculate the **Mean ($\mu$)** of the dataset.
2.  Calculate the **Standard Deviation ($\sigma$)**.
3.  For each point $x$, compute the $Z$ value.
4.  If $|Z| > 3$, the point is an outlier.

**Formula:**
$$Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

**Example:**
* **Dataset:** {10, 12, 14, 100}
* If the mean is 34 and SD is 40, the Z-score for 100 is: $(100 - 34) / 40 = 1.65$. (In a larger dataset of small numbers, 100 would result in $Z > 3$).

### **2. IQR (Boxplot) Algorithm**
**Basic Working Steps:**
1.  Calculate **Q1** (25th percentile) and **Q3** (75th percentile).
2.  Find $IQR = Q3 - Q1$.
3.  Define **Lower Bound** = $Q1 - 1.5(IQR)$.
4.  Define **Upper Bound** = $Q3 + 1.5(IQR)$.
5.  Any point outside these bounds is an outlier.

**Example:**
* **Data:** {5, 10, 15, 20, 100}
* $Q1 = 10, Q3 = 20 \implies IQR = 10$.
* **Upper Bound:** $20 + (1.5 \times 10) = 35$.
* **Result:** 100 is $> 35$, so it is an outlier.
